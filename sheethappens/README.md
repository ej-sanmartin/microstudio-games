**Sheet Happens** is a simple, skill-based arcade game where two carriers hold a cloth and try to keep a jumper bouncing endlessly without letting him fall. Time your moves and stay centered, the higher he goes, the faster it gets!

## How to Play
**Desktop:** Use A / D or ← / → to move the carriers and keep the jumper landing safely on the sheet.

**Mobile:** Tap the left or right side of the screen to move the carriers in that direction.

Every successful bounce earns you a point. Miss the sheet, and it’s game over!
